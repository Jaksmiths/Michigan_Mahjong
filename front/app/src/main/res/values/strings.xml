	<string name="rule_intro">
		Welcome player! You never played Mahjong before?
		You are experienced but need a refresher?
		This guidebook can help you through!\n\n
		Mahjong is a tile-based game where players win various number of points
		from the tile combinations in their playing hand. The simplest way to win
		points is to win a round, but other combinations may also yield points.
	</string>
	<string name="rule_tiles">
		Mahjong consists of 34 different tiles.
		 For each tile, there are 4 of them, so there are a total of 136 tiles.
		 They belong to 5 groups: Man, Pin, Sou, Wind and Dragon.
		 Man, Pin, and Sou each have 9 distinct tiles in their suit, numbered 1 through 9.
		 Wind has 4 distinct tiles in its suit classified as North, East, South, and West
		 and Dragon has 3 distinct tiles in its suit classified as Red, Green and White.
		 The 7 Wind and Dragon together are known as Honors.
	</string>
	<string name="rule_basic">
		When a game starts, a player will have 13 tiles in hand that are hidden to other players.
		 Every time it is your turn, you will draw a tile, making your hand total 14 tiles.
		 You will then have to one of the 14 tiles into the discard pile. This process allows
		 you to change the composition of the tiles in your hand.
	</string>
	<string name="rule_win">
		In order to win a round of the game, you must get a winning hand. You get a winning hand
		 when the 14 tiles you consists of sequences, triplets, and pairs. When you have 13 tiles
		 and only need one more tile to win, your hand is called Tenpai (Ready Hand).
		 Additionally, a winning hand must have a Yaku, which is a specific condition for tile
		 patterns your Tenpai and winning hand must meet.
		\n\n
		Pairs are a set of two identical tiles. Triples (Koutsu) are a set of three identical tiles.
		 Sequences (Shuntsu) are a set of three consecutive tiles from the same group. Usually,
		 you win when your hand consists of four sequences or triplets and a pair.
	</string>
	<string name="rule_tanyao">
		Tanyao means you must not hold any Terminal tiles or Honor tiles in your hand.
		 Terminal tiles are tiles 1 and 9 of the Man, Pin, and Sou groups and Honor tiles
		 are from the Wind and Dragon groups.
	</string>
	<string name="rule_yakuhai">
		Yakuhai refers to having one of the following Triplets:
		Dragon Tiles, Prevalent Wind and Seat Wind.\n\n
		Having a triplet of Red, Green or White can be used as Yaku.
		At the beginning of each round, a wind is assigned to the round and each player.
		Prevalent Wind is three Wind tiles from the current wind type of the round,
		East Wind for East Round, South Wind for South Round, and West Wind for West Round.
		Similarly, Seat Wind is three Wind tiles from of own your player,
		East Wind for East Player, South Wind for South Player, West Wind for West Player,
		and North Wind for North Player.
	</string>
	<string name="rule_riichi">
		Riichi is the distinguishing part of this game and namesake mechanic.\n\n
		Riichi can be declared by a player when the player has Tenpai and at Menzenchin (Closed Hand),
		meaning that player did not steal any tiles (Chii, Pon, Kan). By declaring Riichi, a player
		cannot change the content of their hand with the exception of declaring certain closed quads.
		A player can also decide not to declare Riichi, in which case the player would continue
		playing as normal.\n\n
		When calling Riichi, a player must declare before discarding their tile, place 1000 points
		stick out, and turn the tile sideways when they discard. The player then continues on
		autopilot until picking up the winning tile. The advantages of Riichi is one Yaku,
		increasing the value of the hand and allows the winner to receive any 1000 point stick.
	</string>
	<string name="rule_advanced">
		There are 42 Yakus total and various other mechanics. The next section will cover several
		mechanics you may encounter, followed by a list of Yakus.
	</string>
	<string name="rule_open">
		Each player discards unwanted tiles to the discard pile. You can steal those discarded
		tiles in certain circumstances. Upon stealing a tile and forming a valid combination,
		the stolen tile and tiles from your hand that make the combination are open, meaning
		they are displayed out to the other players. Your hand is no longer Menzenchin.\n\n
		Chii is called to steal from the player who last discarded (player on your left)
		in order to form a valid Sequence with two tiles from your hand.\n\n
		Pon is called to complete a Triplet with two tiles in your hand. You can call
		Pon on any player that discards.\n\n
		Kan is called to complete a Quad, which is four identical tiles. You can call
		Kan when you have a Triplet in your hand on any player that discards and can also call
		Kan when you draw the fourth tile to complete an existing Triplet.\n\n
		Open tiles will be displayed with one tile turned sideways like such.
	</string>
	<string name="rule_furiten">
		When a player is in a state of Furiten, the player cannot declare a winning hand from
		another player\'s discards meaning the player in Furiten can only win from self drawn tiles.
		There are three Furiten states: Discard Furiten, Temporary Furiten, and Riichi Furiten.\n\n
		Discard Furiten occurs when a player discared any potential winning tiles from their
		current hand.\n\n
		Temporary Furiten occurs to a player for a turn if a winning tile was discarded and the
		player did not call it. Temporary Furiten ends after the player discards a tile.\n\n
		Riichi Furiten occurs when a player declares Riichi and does not call a potential winning
		tile that was discarded after declaration.
	</string>
	<string name="rule_draw">
		There is a possibility that the round ends in a draw, where no player wins.\n\n
		Four-Wind Discard - When each player discards the same Wind Tile in the first turn.\n\n
		Four-Kan Abortion - When two or more players called for a total of four Quads.\n\n
		Four-Player Riichi - When all four players declare Riichi.\n\n
		Nine different Terminals and Honors - If you hand consists of nine different terminal and
		honor tiles, you have the option to declare a draw in your first turn before any tiles
		are called.
	</string>
	<string name="rule_yaku_overview">
		Yakus can be separated into several different categories which yield a different number of
		points. These are 1-Han, 2-Han, 3-Han, 6-Han, Mangan, and Yakuman. The three basic
		Yakus covered earlier, Riichi, Yakuhai, and Tanyao all fall under 1-Han.

	</string>
	<string name="rule_dora">
		Another feature to earn points is Dora.
		There are dead wall tiles present at the beginning of the game. At the start, one of the
		tiles from the dead wall is placed faced up. That tile is called the Dora indicator.
		A tile that is the next in the same suit (where terminals loop to the beginning) is worth
		one Han per tile. Also, in Japanese Mahjong, there are red dora which is an extra Han.
		Ura-dora is when winning using Riichi, the rest of the tiles in dead wall can be used
		as Dora indicators.
	</string>
	<string name="strat_intro">
		Here you can find some of helpful strategies for beginners and some of our favorite more
		complex strategies.
	</string>
	<string name="strat_yaku">
		Riichi is the easiest Yaku to achieve. It is difficult to get a Yaku with an open hand
		unless you already have Yaku. Otherwise, stealing to complete a Yaku is a way to
		guarantee Yaku along with giving yourself more available moves to make.
	</string>
	<string name="strat_defense">
		When an opponent calls Riichi, they are close to victory.
		In order to avoid having Ron called on you, it’s a good idea to start playing defensively.
		You can do this by discarding tiles that match tiles found in the opponent’s discard pile.
	</string>
	<string name="strat_wait">
		There are 3 types of waits as seen in the image.
		To create a group, side waits are most advantageous as you can complete them with
		8 tiles as opposed to 4. Closed waits are better than edge waits because they can evolve
		into a side wait with 2 kinds of tiles as opposed to an edge wait (1 kind).
	</string>
	<string name="strat_thirteen">
		When you decide to go for Thirteen Orphans, you are giving up all other ways of winning,
		so at which point does it seem to be a reasonable choice? In the “9 types 9 tiles”
		situation, should you draw?\n\n
		Answer is: when you have more than 11 tiles from the “Thirteen Orphans” set
		[m19,s19,p19,RGW,ESWN], it seems to be a wise choice to go for Thirteen Orphans.\n
		Ref: http://yabejp.web.fc2.com/mahjong/tactics/chapter01/section038.html
	</string>
	<string name="strat_point">
		When the game is closer to its end, point standing can affect the decision to declare
		Riichi or not in many ways. For starters, players who have a large lead will be more cautious,
		and the risk of less win rate or hand locking become amplified for them, while the reward of
		increasing value and intimidation are lessened. Players who are greatly behind,
		on the other hand, will likely cling to Riichi\'s increase in value, as all the risks in
		the world no longer matter to them. Players who are in the middle will also start having
		specific point goals for their hands to achieve their goals - one player may choose to
		damaten their hand because it is large enough to overcome the difference to another
		player\'s score, while another may choose to declare Riichi because they need the
		extra points to do so. For these players there are no fast and hard rules to adhere
		to any more - they simply have to analyze their own situation and decide what goals
		to set for their hands, and whether declaring Riichi would fit (or not fit) into their plan.
		\nRef: https://riichi.wiki/Riichi_strategy
	</string>
	<string name="strat_quad">
		By making a concealed quad, player could lose safety tiles and the new dora could go
		to the opponents. Keep in mind, if your hand is close to ready for chiitoitsu, one of the
		four tiles can be used as a good floating tile, or if you might lose some yaku if you make
		the set into a quad, you should avoid making a concealed quad.
